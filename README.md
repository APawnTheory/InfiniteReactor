----------Project Overview----------

This project contains a program called InfiniteReactor, designed to monitor a specific pixel's color and trigger actions when the color changes. 
It was specifically created to assist with the Reaction Time Test on the Human Benchmark website. [https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime].

----------Folder Structure----------

1. InfiniteReactor.exe
The compiled version of the cheat/hack.
This is the standalone executable file that you can run directly without requiring Python or additional setup.

2. Source Code
The Python script InfiniteReactor.py is included in this directory.
You can use this file if you wish to explore, modify, or run the program using Python directly.

3. .spec
The .spec file containsall the required dependencies for the program and must not be deleted.

----------Modifying the Code----------

If you wish to make changes, open InfiniteReactor.py in a Python editor (e.g., Spyder, VSCode).
Ensure all dependencies (pyautogui, pynput, win32gui, etc.) are installed before running.
